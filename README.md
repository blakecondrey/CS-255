SNHU, CS-255 - System Analysis and Design
<p>This course is intended to facilitate an exploration of the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.</p>

<li><b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b></li>
<br>
<p>The DriverPass project was a simulated, proof-of-concept project where we as students were tasked with developing a mock analysis of a proposed system that was intended to better educate young, training drivers to pass their examinations via extensive training through an online protal that gave students learning modules, exams, and a scheduling module to take hands-on driver training courses.</p>

<li><b>What did you do particularly well?</b></li>
<br>
<p>I feel confident that my strongest attributes were design implementations, specifically with the UML Activity Diagrams and the UML Class Diagram.</p>

<li><b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b></li>
<br>
<p>I'd probably like to revisit the business require documents. It's imperitive to revist and <i>iterate</i> our processes, and given that I learned more about the system as time went on, I don't feel as confident that the business requirements are as sturdy as they were previously.</p>

<li><b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b></li>
<br>
<p>Simply put, by reading the transcript, and reading it again with an emphasis on imagining that I was truly present for it. I could visualize the importance of some features that the client's not only wanted, but expected. Listening and documenting these user needs are critical to closing gaps with business pain-points.</p>

<li><b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
</b></li>
<br>
<p>Intently documenting user needs or other variables that are necessary to the system, and then translating that into the design document - a data-flow diagram, a class diagram, or even an activity diagram. In the future, I would hope that my employer would provide the team with tools that help streamline this process - like LucidChart for business, Jira, confluence, etc.</p>
